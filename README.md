- 👋 Hi, I’m @kevinfrteels
- 👀 I’m interested in just about everything  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to connect apps through API calls and use the data in meaningful ways.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on pulling data from the Ubiquiti UNMS app and then experiment with methods of displaying and using that information.
- 📫 How to reach me  - well you can try chanting but I've heard that doesn't work. So most people just send an email to kevin at kevin freels com
